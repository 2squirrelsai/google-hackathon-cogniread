# Icon Requirements

CogniRead needs the following icon files in this directory:

- `icon16.png` (16x16 pixels)
- `icon48.png` (48x48 pixels)
- `icon128.png` (128x128 pixels)

## Design Suggestions

The icon should represent:
- Reading/book focus (ðŸ“– open book emoji concept)
- Accessibility
- Reading/text
- Clarity and simplicity

## Color Palette

Use colors from the brand gradient:
- Primary: #667eea (purple-blue)
- Secondary: #313F2C (purple)
- Accent: #4285f4 (Google blue)

## Quick Solution

For rapid prototyping, you can:
1. Use an online icon generator
2. Create simple colored squares with the open book emoji (ðŸ“–)
3. Use a design tool like Figma, Canva, or Photoshop

## Placeholder Icons

Until you create custom icons, the extension will still work but Chrome will show a default extension icon.

## Example Design

A simple but effective design could be:
- Background: Gradient from #667eea to #313F2C
- Foreground: White brain icon or stylized book with sparkles
- Style: Flat, modern, accessible

Remember: The icon represents accessibility and clarity, so keep it simple and recognizable even at 16x16 pixels!
