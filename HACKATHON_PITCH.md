# CogniRead - Hackathon Pitch

## üéØ 30-Second Pitch

CogniRead is a Chrome extension that makes the web accessible for the 15-20% of people with cognitive differences like ADHD, dyslexia, or autism. Using Chrome's built-in AI APIs, it transforms any webpage into an easy-to-read format with features like Focus Mode, TL;DR summaries, and adaptive complexity adjustment‚Äîall processed on-device for privacy.

## üî• The Hook

**300+ million people** with dyslexia and **366 million** with ADHD struggle with web content daily, yet current accessibility tools ignore cognitive accessibility. We're filling a **$8.3 billion market gap**.

## üí° Problem Statement

1. Web content is designed for neurotypical readers
2. People with learning differences spend **3-5x longer** reading online
3. Current accessibility tools focus only on visual/hearing impairments
4. No privacy-friendly solutions for cognitive accessibility exist

## ‚ú® Our Solution

CogniRead provides:
- **Focus Mode**: One paragraph at a time (ADHD-friendly)
- **TL;DR Mode**: AI-generated bullet summaries
- **Complexity Slider**: Adjust reading level 1-10
- **Dyslexia Mode**: Enhanced spacing and fonts
- **Definition Bubbles**: Hover explanations for difficult words
- **Progress Tracking**: Visual reading completion

## üöÄ Chrome AI APIs Integration

We combine **4 Chrome AI APIs** in one solution:
1. **Summarizer API**: Extract key points
2. **Rewriter API**: Simplify complex text
3. **Prompt API**: Analyze cognitive complexity
4. **Translator API**: Convert idioms to literal language

All processing is **on-device**‚Äîno external servers, perfect privacy.

2. **Privacy-first**: All processing on-device
3. **Real-time adaptation**: No pre-processing needed
4. **Customizable**: Each user's cognitive needs are different
5. **Scientifically grounded**: Uses Flesch Reading Ease and proven metrics

## üìä Market Opportunity

- **Target Users**: 300M dyslexia + 366M ADHD + 75M autism = **741M people**
- **TAM**: $8.3B assistive technology market
- **Current Competition**: Zero solutions for cognitive web accessibility
- **Use Cases**: Education, professional development, daily browsing

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Implementation

**Architecture**:

## Demo Script (3 minutes)

**[0:00-0:30] Problem**
"I'm going to read you a paragraph from a typical Wikipedia article. [Read complex sentence]. For someone with ADHD or dyslexia, this is exhausting. Now watch what CogniRead does..."

**[0:30-1:00] Focus Mode**
"With one click, Focus Mode highlights just one paragraph, dimming everything else. Arrow keys let me move forward. No more losing my place."

**[1:00-1:30] TL;DR Mode**
"Too long? TL;DR Mode uses Chrome's AI to create bullet points. The entire article summarized in seconds‚Äîon your device, privately."

**[1:30-2:00] Complexity Slider**
"But maybe I want to read it all. The complexity slider adapts the content to my reading level. Watch as the text simplifies from college level to middle school."

**[2:00-2:30] Dyslexia Mode**
"For dyslexia? Special fonts, extra spacing, better readability. Combined with our other features, it's transformative."

**[2:30-3:00] Closing**
"All powered by Chrome's built-in AI‚Äîno external servers, no privacy concerns. This is cognitive accessibility for 741 million people. Thank you."

## Questions You Might Get

**Q: How is this different from text-to-speech?**
A: We don't just read text aloud‚Äîwe fundamentally restructure it for comprehension. We simplify sentences, create summaries, adjust complexity, and provide contextual definitions.

**Q: What about accuracy of AI simplification?**
A: We use Chrome's built-in Gemini Nano model, which is optimized for on-device tasks. We also provide fallback methods and let users control the complexity level.

**Q: Who's your competition?**
A: There are reading tools and visual accessibility tools, but no comprehensive cognitive accessibility solution. We're creating a new category.

**Q: How do you make money?**
A: For the hackathon, we're focused on impact. Future monetization could include premium features, educational licenses, and B2B enterprise sales.

**Q: Privacy concerns?**
A: All AI processing is on-device using Chrome's built-in APIs. We never send data to external servers. Perfect for protecting vulnerable users.

**Q: What about other browsers?**
A: We started with Chrome because of the AI APIs, but the cognitive engine and UI could be adapted to Firefox, Edge, etc. with different AI backends.
